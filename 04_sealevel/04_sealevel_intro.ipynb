    "The National Oceanography Centre of the UK maintains a [database of tide gauge records](https://psmsl.org/data/obtaining/) from around the world. You can choose any location you'd like provided it has about 50+ years of data (this is a rough guideline, it's okay if you pick somewhere with a slightly shorter record) and also includes real time data access. For example, here is a screenshot of the station page for the Boston tide gauge:\n",
