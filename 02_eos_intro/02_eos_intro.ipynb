    "In class this week you will learn about the equation of state. This is a thermodynamic equation that relates the density of ocean water to temperature, salinity, and pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the simplest level, the density of seawater increases with salinity and decreases with temperature. It is possible to approximate this as a linear function, e.g. $\\rho(T,S) = \\beta S - \\alpha T$, where $\\rho$ is density, $S$ is salinity, $T$ is temperature, and $\\beta$ and $\\alpha$ are coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in reality, the equation of state of seawater is nonlinear and also depends on pressure. Oceanographers widely use a collection of functions called the [Gibbs-SeaWater (GSW) Oceanographic Toolbox](https://www.teos-10.org/software.htm) to standardize conversions between the variables that our instruments can measure (e.g. in situ temperature, conductivity, and pressure) to derived quantities like potential temperature, salinity, and density that we use in our analyses.\n",

    "You can see the density contours (**isopycnals**) curving because the equation of state is nonlinear. For example, follow the 23 kg/m$^3$ contour line from bottom left to top right. At very low temperatures, the tangent to the contour is nearly vertical, which means that salinity has a stronger effect on density than temperature does. But at higher temperatures, the effect of temperature becomes larger."

    "All of the water is relatively cold so the y-axis on this plot only goes from about -1 to 6 degrees Celsius, while the salinity range is relatively large. As mentioned above, the density at low temperature depends very strongly on salinity, so the isopycnals appear very steep. This is why the salinity and density profiles have such similar shapes, despite the significant changes in temperature with depth.\n",

This plot shows temperature increasing initially, then decreasing, and then increasing again. But even as the deeper waters get warmer with depth, salinity continues to increase. This means that density is highest at the bottom and the water column is stable."
