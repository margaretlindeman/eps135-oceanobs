This mooring is located on the continental shelf off the southeast coast of Greenland, with a bottom depth of approximately 180 m. In your first homework assignment, you plotted temperature and pressure records from the deepest sensor on this mooring. The schematic below shows the entire OSNAP array with arrows indicating the large scale ocean circulation in this region, including the southward-flowing East Greenland Current system. Strong ocean currents are sometimes observed at the location of CF3.\n",
